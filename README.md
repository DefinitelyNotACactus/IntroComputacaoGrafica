## T1 - Rasterization
#### Introduction
For this task, we have implemented algorithms to rasterize pixels, lines and triangles on the screen, as per Foley et. al rasterization is:
>Approximation of mathematical ('ideal') primitives, described in terms of vertices on a Cartesian grid, by sets of pixels of the appropriate intensity of gray or color.

Current operating systems blocks users from modifying the memory directly, and therefore, a framework was provided by the teacher to simulate access to the video memory using OpenGL.

### Requirements

> * OpenGL 
> * GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit) 
> * A C/C++ compiler

###### Note: In terms of environment, we've used Windows operating system and NetBeans IDE with MinGW compiler.
